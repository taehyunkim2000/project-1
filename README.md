Discussion on Project Results
The Inventory Management System (IMS) project has been successfully implemented. The system allows the store to manage its inventory, record sales, and generate reports efficiently.

Conclusion
The Inventory Management System project successfully demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming, data management, and reporting. While this is a simplified version, it lays the groundwork for a more comprehensive and practical IMS that can be used in a retail store.
