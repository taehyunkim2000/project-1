Implemented Functionalities
Product Class: Created a class to represent individual products with attributes such as name, category, price, quantity in stock, and a unique product identifier.

Inventory Class: Implemented an Inventory class responsible for managing the store's inventory. It provides methods for adding products, updating stock levels, and retrieving product information.

Transaction Class: Created a Transaction class to represent individual sales, including the products sold, quantities, and total amounts.

Stock Management: Implemented methods to update stock levels when products are purchased or restocked.

Reports: Developed functionality to generate two types of reports: current stock levels and sales history.

Discussion on Project Results
The Inventory Management System (IMS) project has been successfully implemented. The system allows the store to manage its inventory, record sales, and generate reports efficiently. Here are some key points regarding the project:

The IMS project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming principles to create a functional and organized system.

It provides a foundation for tracking products, managing stock, and analyzing sales data.

The system is currently text-based, but it can be extended to include a graphical user interface (GUI) for more user-friendly interaction.

Error handling and data persistence are aspects that can be improved for a production-ready system.

The IMS project can be further enhanced by adding features like user authentication, data storage in a database, and more advanced reporting capabilities.

Overall, the project serves as a solid starting point for developing a real-world inventory management solution.

Conclusion
The Inventory Management System project successfully demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming, data management, and reporting. While this is a simplified version, it lays the groundwork for a more comprehensive and practical IMS that can be used in a retail store.
